# Assignment05=7: HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE

### Project Overview
My project involves an improvement and expansion of the existing World Health Organization COVID-19 resource website. Here, I use a high-fidelity prototype to demonstrate additional features and reinvisioned site interface design. A high-fidelity prototype serves to materialize the insights of user research and designer solutions by being an interactive sample of (nearly) the product in action. With a more concrete model, we are able to demonstrate ideas in mind and test the prototype itself, which can bring to light more potential insights from firsthand experience. 

### Tasks + Representative Screens

This prototype supports the following tasks:

1) **COVID-19 Symptom Checker:** While offering information about the Coronavirus, the WHO does not have a more direct way for users to apply symptom information in real life. In addition to knowing about symptoms for common knowledge, users may be reading to compare what they may feel themselves. To make this more feasible, the Symptom Checker will use user demographics, situation (living situation, health care work, travel), pre-existing conditions, and COVID-19 symptoms to assess users' risks, give action items, and further reading resources.

2) **Hideable Worldwide statistics:** An eye-catching feature of the WHO site is their presentation of worldwide COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as the countries affected. Currently, this is just shown numerically, but links to another site of theirs dedicated to this. While this is interesting and frequently reported on the news, this can be overwhelming for some. So, making it as a show/hide function can remove it from view. In addition, providing it as a chart as opposed to just the values can contextualize the situation more for those who want to know.

3) **Local dashboard:** This is a new section that allows users to get more localized news, information, and resources, which was determined to be valuable from prior research feedback. While the WHO is in the business of generalized information of worldwide coverage, it would be helpful for them as a trusted source to connect users with the existing sources in their area. This dashboard provides a hub of sorts that shows news by media type and resource by focus in a graphical manner (since people are more likely to recognize logos than lists), and (in action, but can't be shown in the prototype) hyperlinks out to those agencies and organizations' sites.

4) **Setting location:** To have a 'functional' (mocked here for prototype purposes) Local Dash, one would need to input their location. This can be done through using your phone's location services with permission, or manual user input (mocked here for protoype purposes). This would be a one-time setup, which then users can refer back to or change if they were to change places as well.

### Graphic Design + User Interface 
For the graphic elements of the site, I decided to build from the WHO's existing site and their branding, which is rather consistent and modern enough already, as it is something users would realistically expect if this site improvement were to replace the current one. 
- The wHO's main colors itself are the #008DC9 blue-teal and #FFFFFF white, with black text and an occasional complementary #CC5500 burnt-orange sprinkled for high-priority attention-grabbing. From here, I started playing with colors, adding more muted tints of the light blues and greys to add some variety in the interface backdrop and buttons, but still be monochromatic and not clashing. 
- For much of the text, the color is actually a dark grey as opposed to black, to keep with the advice learned from class as to not be straining to the eye. I also stuck with the same Arial and other sans serif variations to follow WHO branding and also be more sleek and readable. 
- Clickable buttons follow from the site, but placed in a 2-column and includes icons for some design heuristics application. Much of the old site was largely text based, so this is just a way to break up space and be visually appealing as well.
- For the Local Dashboard news and resources pages, I opted for carousels to simplify presentation (as opposed to listed hyperlinks to be scrolled down. I found this to be more appealing in regards to categorizing what I wanted to display (thought process: should I list things alphabetically? by area? how would I note they belong to x y z category without having too many nested pages?). I found it was much more ideal to present resources horizontally to swipe through, and with recognizable logos as opposed to a page full of Arial text. 
- For the interface, I stuck to a 1-2 column max display to save space where possible and show a more, but not overwhelming, amount of information/clickable options, without being overwhelming. A critique from the orignal site from design heuristics was the lack of consistency for its format between pages and as you scrolled down. THere, I aimed at correcting this to make the site more inviting and also more intuitive since similar actions and structures follow between sections. 
- Note: I designed this as a mobile site that can be searched on the go, but I also did so with the logic of whatever works (fits/is feasible) to present on a phone can definitely be possible on the desktop. I imagine a desktop site largely following the same formats, with just some widening to accomodate for the landscape dimensions. I decided to work backwards as the original side was not mobile friendly.

#### Impression Test
0: No evidence of the impression test
+1: Provide the evidence of impression test with the raw data (video/audio recording) or the quotation/transcript
+1: Summary of findings 

#### Accessibility
To test color contrast, I used the Stark Adobe XD Plugin. To gauge the entire prototype's AA level accessibility efficiently, I tested the areas of text and colors that were the smallest or the least visually contrasted. If these bits passed, then the other elements would surely do so. I did find that I had to change some of the original colors I began using, as I just experimented with the color grabber tool to choose them.

#### Wireflow:
0: No updated wireflow with screen design
+1: Complete interaction sequences for the three features were clearly presented in the wireflow WITH screen designs 

#### Cognitive Walkthrough
0: No evidence of cognitive walkthrough
+1: Provide the evidence of cognitive walkthrough
+1: Summary of findings 


### Reflection:
description of what you learned from other’s feedback and what you have made the changes
0: No summary or reflection 
+1: Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation

+1: What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. 
Tip: if your multiple versions of the prototype design reflect your time and effort to improve from other’s feedback, it is a good reason for the instructor to give you extra credits
