# World Health Organization COVID-19 2.0
#### Anjenica Celine (Nikki) Ramos, DH 150: UX/UI

## Introduction
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.

In the midst of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, people are more cognizant of health and safety like never before. Now more than ever, people turn to reliable sources like the World Health Organization (WHO), an renowned international agency, for critical information on COVID-19. Driven by this present widespread need, I propose a renovation of the current WHO COVID-19 resource site and addition of new components to present an accessible, understandable, and actionable resource for the public. In this way, we are designing for public service and potential good, as the improvement of the site's user experience and interface can provide practical utility for countless lives in communities worldwide. 

we are seeing the way information (and misinformation) lead to confusion and hysteria. However, the manner information is conveyed and understood can be shaped for serve public good. UX design plays an underlyingly pivotal role in the connection of the public to resources effectively to steer their courses of action towards safety and empathy. In addition, UX is key in enabling countless individuals to navigate through this critical time where human interaction is restricted. Therefore, it is an underlying urgency that we give focus to the usability of these online resources.

When deciding what kind of public websites/apps I wanted focus on, what called out most to me was choosing something that is relevant to the real world and holds potential utility. I'm generally driven by design in its ability to communicate information and influence action. Inspired by current events, I became interested in focusing my heuristic evaluation, as hopfully my overall project, on public resources in relation to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. My first site of choice for Assignment01 is https://www.coronavirus.gov/, the COVID-19 information site by the World Health Organization (WHO).



## Design Statement
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

In every newscast and social media post, we are witnessing the way misinformation can bring about confusion, hysteria, and disfunction. For COVID-19, this can bring about conspiracies of mystical remedies and negligence that can escalate the situation further. It is important to have factual information and advice from a trusted source like the WHO to combat this. However, this in itself is still not enough if the way the information is presented is itself incomprehensible, overwhelming, or disorganized. The manner information is conveyed is critical for public reach and application. And so, pursuing the problem of information communication is important as we're seeing the chaos the lack of it brings. While this cannot combat the virus directly, the improvement of the WHO COVID-19 site can arm countless individuals to make sound, informed decisions that can deter its spread and connect those at risk to actionable steps. 


## Competitor Analysis 

### Heuristic Evaluation
Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the *existing* product(s) - or the *original* website you evaluated
Initially, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the existing World Health Organization COVID-19 site. It captured my attention as one of the first listed sources when searching COVID-19 online. At first glance, this site appears generally functional and rather modern, as it ought to have been just earlier this year, though exploration revealed numerous points of concern surrounding its lack of consistency and inefficient information presentation.

### User Testing
To gather outside perspectives on the site, I conducted a usability pilot test, which enabled me to assess the site's interface by seeing it in use by a volunteer participant. With the goals of evaluating the site's effectivity, efficiency, and satisfaction of use as a public resource, the participant's success in completing tasks of defining common terms, getting answers to potential COVID-19 questions, finding WHO travel guidelines, and navigating WHO social media updates revealed the strengths and weaknesses of the existing site. This revealed drawbacks in the text-heavy content and unpredictable page structure that made looking for specific information cumbersome and time-consuming.

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:

In gathering further insight, I conducted a participatory observation session and interview with a user of the site's target demographic. In comparison to usability testing, this allows the participant to give feedback more openly as they were more freely able to explore the site (guided by moderator questions and prompts). In this more conversational interaction, I was able to gather the context for the product's use (searching questions or concerns on-the-go, on both desktop or mobile, based on situational need). I was also able to gauge the general context of information consumption, needs, and expectations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as gather user opinons of the site's interface, contents.
I learned the user seeks Coronavirus information regularly, if not daily, and heavily weighs the source's credibility in trusting it, and regularly going back to it. They also have interest in relevant, actionable information that they can utilize in their daily life, both in terms of knowledge/general awareness and courses of action in navigating the situation on a day to day basis. From their behavior, I was able to see the clear points of high interest in the site, and others which were skimmed over. Lastly, while the user was willing to spend time to look for information, it often took repetitive skimming to do so.

## UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]

To widen my consideration of various potential users who may turn to the WHO COVID-19 site, I constructed (3) user personas and scenarios to contextualize the multitude of reasons and needs the improved site must address. 
1. Dan Miller, a husband, dad, and teacher who is responsible for guiding his family and students through COVID. He'll need a COVID-19 site that is easily navigatable, memorable for recurring reference, and reliable enough to recommend to fellow collegues, his students, and their parents. 
> Dan could benefit from a restructed WHO site whose tabular homepage and consistent, straightforward information would allow him to find what he needs, relay the information to those in his life, and pass along the source himself. 
2. Bethany Ramirez is a working professional who just relocated to a new city before the virus struck, leaving her unfamiliar with her surroundings while self-isolating alone. She'll need a COVID-19 source that will inform her about the situation, as well as point her towards trusted resources and statistics that are in her area. 
> Bethany could benefit from the inclusion of geographically local news, statistics, and resources in a section that will be a one-stop-shop towards arming herself with relevant knowledge and launching point to connect with nearby supprt. 
3. Kathryn Chen is a parent, immigrant, and small business owner who may have been exposed to the COVID-19. She'll need a COVID-19 source that will allow her to assess her symptoms and act accordingy, while being easily undertandable for someone with English as a second language. 
> Kathryn could benefit from the creation of a symptom checker that allows quick self-assessment and provides recommended next steps in addition to potential deeper reading, so that she is able to act in the best interest of her and her child's health.

7) Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment06 + part of 07]

The wireframe and flow sketches here outline the initial inception of these potential solutions. A redesigned site that is functionable on mobile will surely be adaptable to work online. A streamlined homepage displays the various directions one can go when visiting the WHO COVID-19 site, whether it be to gather general understanding, answer specific concerns, or look into innovative research and unfolding news. Immediately, users can access the Symptom Checker, answer questions about symptoms, demographics, and recent activity to get a recommendation. They can also look at local and global statistics from a collapsable module. By using one's location information, users can also use the Local Dashboard to get information tailored to their area.
