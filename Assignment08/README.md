1) Project title + Your name
#World Health Organization COVID-19 2.0

2) Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.

In the midst of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, people are more cognizant of health and safety like never before. Now more than ever, people turn to reliable sources like the World Health Organization (WHO), an renowned international agency, for critical information on COVID-19. Driven by this present widespread need, I propose a renovation of the current WHO COVID-19 resource site and addition of new components to present an accessible, understandable, and actionable resource for the public. In this way, we are designing for public service and potential good, as the improvement of the site's user experience and interface can provide practical utility for countless lives in communities worldwide. 

we are seeing the way information (and misinformation) lead to confusion and hysteria. However, the manner information is conveyed and understood can be shaped for serve public good. UX design plays an underlyingly pivotal role in the connection of the public to resources effectively to steer their courses of action towards safety and empathy. In addition, UX is key in enabling countless individuals to navigate through this critical time where human interaction is restricted. Therefore, it is an underlying urgency that we give focus to the usability of these online resources.

When deciding what kind of public websites/apps I wanted focus on, what called out most to me was choosing something that is relevant to the real world and holds potential utility. I'm generally driven by design in its ability to communicate information and influence action. Inspired by current events, I became interested in focusing my heuristic evaluation, as hopfully my overall project, on public resources in relation to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. My first site of choice for Assignment01 is https://www.coronavirus.gov/, the COVID-19 information site by the World Health Organization (WHO).




3) Clear design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 
In every newscast and social media post, we are witnessing the way misinformation can bring about confusion, hysteria, and disfunction. For COVID-19, this can bring about conspiracies of mystical remedies and negligence that can escalate the situation further. It is important to have factual information and advice from a trusted source like the WHO to combat this. However, this in itself is still not enough if the way the information is presented is itself incomprehensible, overwhelming, or disorganized. The manner information is conveyed is critical for public reach and application. And so, pursuing the problem of information communication is important as we're seeing the chaos the lack of it brings. While this cannot combat the virus directly, the improvement of the WHO COVID-19 site can arm countless individuals to make sound, informed decisions that can deter its spread and connect those at risk to actionable steps.
