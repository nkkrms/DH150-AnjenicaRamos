[ASSIGNMENT 01: UX HEAURISTIC EVALUATION](https://github.com/nkkrms/DH150-AnjenicaRamos/blob/master/Assignment01.md) 

When deciding what kind of public websites/apps I wanted focus on, what called out most to me was choosing something that is relevant to the real world and holds potential utility. I'm generally driven by design in its ability to communicate information and influence action. Inspired by current events, I became interested in focusing my heuristic evaluation, as hopfully my overall project, on public resources in relation to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. My first site of choice for Assignment01 is https://www.coronavirus.gov/, the COVID-19 information site by the World Health Organization (WHO). My second choice regards the State of California's employment initiative site, https://www.caljobs.ca.gov, a platform focused on connecting CA residents with employment opportunites that has long since existed, but has since likely gained much traffic in relation to the unemployment caused by the pandemic.

In real time, we are seeing the way information (and misinformation) lead to confusion and hysteria. However, the manner information is conveyed and understood can be shaped for serve public good. UX design plays an underlyingly pivotal role in the connection of the public to resources effectively to steer their courses of action towards safety and empathy. In addition, UX is key in enabling countless individuals to navigate through this critical time where human interaction is restricted. Therefore, it is an underlying urgency that we give focus to the usability of these online resources.
