# World Health Organization COVID-19 2.0
#### Anjenica Celine (Nikki) Ramos, DH 150: UX/UI

## Introduction
In the midst of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, people are more cognizant of health and safety like never before. Now more than ever, people turn to reliable sources like the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) (WHO), an renowned international agency, for critical information on COVID-19. Driven by this present widespread need, I propose a renovation of the current WHO COVID-19 resource site and addition of new components to present an accessible, understandable, and actionable resource for the public. This way, we are designing for public service and potential good, as the improvement of the site's user experience and interface can provide practical utility for countless lives worldwide.

## Design Statement
In every social media post, we are witnessing the way misinformation can bring about confusion, hysteria, and disfunction. For COVID-19, this can bring about conspiracies of mystical remedies and negligence that can escalate the situation further. It is important to have factual information and advice from a trusted source like the WHO to combat this. However, this in itself is still not enough if the way the information is presented is itself incomprehensible, overwhelming, and disorganized. The manner information is conveyed is critical for public reach and application, so pursuing the problem of information communication is important as we're seeing the chaos the lack therof brings. While this cannot combat the virus directly, the improvement of the WHO COVID-19 site can arm individuals to make sound, informed decisions that can deter its spread and connect those at risk to further steps. 

## Competitor Analysis
### Heuristic Evaluation
Initially, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the existing World Health Organization COVID-19 site. It captured my attention as one of the first listed sources when searching COVID-19 online. At first glance, this site appears generally functional and rather modern, as it ought to have been just earlier this year, though exploration revealed numerous points of concern surrounding its lack of consistency and inefficient information presentation.

### User Testing
To gather outside perspectives on the site, I conducted a usability pilot test, which enabled me to assess the site by seeing it in use by a volunteer participant. With the goals of evaluating the site's effectivity, efficiency, and satisfaction of use as a public resource, the participant's success in completing tasks of defining common terms, getting answers to potential COVID-19 questions, finding WHO travel guidelines, and navigating WHO social media updates revealed the strengths of the existing site in its basic functions. However, it also revealed drawbacks in the text-heavy content and unpredictable page structure that made looking for specific information cumbersome and time-consuming.

### User Research
In gathering further insight, I conducted a participatory observation session and interview with a user of the site's target demographic. In comparison to usability testing, this allows the participant to give feedback more openly as they were more freely able to explore the site (guided by moderator questions and prompts) as opposed to soley trying to complete preset tasks. In this more conversational interaction, I was able to gather the context for the product's use (searching questions or concerns on-the-go, on both desktop or mobile, based on situational need). I was also able to gauge the context of the target audience's consumption, needs, and expectations regarding the COVID-19 information, as well as gather user opinons of the site's interface, contents. I learned the user seeks Coronavirus information regularly, if not daily, and heavily weighs the source's credibility in trusting it and regularly going back to it. They also have interest in relevant, actionable information that they can utilize in their daily life, both in terms of knowledge/general awareness and courses of action in navigating the situation on a day to day basis. From their behavior, I was able to see the clear points of high interest in the site, and others which were skimmed over. Lastly, while the user was willing to spend time to look for information, it often took repetitive skimming to do so.

### UX Storytelling
To widen my consideration of various potential users who may turn to the WHO COVID-19 site, I constructed (3) user personas and scenarios to contextualize the multitude of reasons and needs the improved site must address. 

**Dan Miller**, a husband, dad, and teacher who is responsible for guiding his family and students through COVID. He'll need a COVID-19 site that is easily navigatable, memorable for recurring reference, and reliable enough to recommend to fellow collegues, his students, and their parents.
> Dan could benefit from a restructed WHO site whose tabular homepage and consistent, straightforward information would allow him to find what he needs, relay the information to those in his life, and pass along the source himself.

**Bethany Ramirez** is a working professional who just relocated to a new city before the virus struck, leaving her unfamiliar with her surroundings while self-isolating alone. She'll need a COVID-19 source that will inform her about the situation, as well as point her towards trusted resources and statistics that are in her area.
> Bethany could benefit from the inclusion of geographically local news, statistics, and resources in a section that will be a one-stop-shop towards arming herself with relevant knowledge and launching point to connect with nearby supprt.

**Kathryn Chen** is a parent, immigrant, and small business owner who may have been exposed to the COVID-19. She'll need a COVID-19 source that will allow her to assess her symptoms and act accordingy, while being easily undertandable for someone with English as a second language.
> Kathryn could benefit from the creation of a symptom checker that allows quick self-assessment and provides recommended next steps in addition to potential deeper reading, so that she is able to act in the best interest of her and her child's health.

### Wireframe + Graphic Design
The wireframe and flow sketches here outline the initial inception of these potential solutions. When initially creating each screen, I want to stick to a minimalistic display that was straight to the point in the info it needs to convey. I wanted to minimize the amount of scrolling the user needs to do and make sure each page's purpose was clear and useful. Regarding the flow, I wanted it to follow one another intuitively, so that users could understand quickly (ideally from first use) how to interact with the page and move between frames. I gathered information from the WHO site, and the CDC about symptoms and consulted existing symptom surveys, which seemed pretty rudamentary on their own since these features don't seem to be widespread yet. In general, about the process of developing my initial wireframes and flow, I thought about how to get from a to b and do tasks step by step, and thought I'd just build on additional features once I had a foundation laid out.

In terms of the graphic interface, I decided to build up from the existing World Health Organization's branding of a teal-blue and white, with black/grey text and burnt orange accent color for attention-grabbing. I added muted monochromatic tints of those base colors to add variation to backgrounds, depth to features, and highlight certain areas without reducing the simplicity of the design. I also implemented text as grey mostly instead of black as in the current site to reduce harshness on the eyes, but still retain WCAG AA-level accessibility. Overall, I wanted the site to be recognizable for users if this were implemented and users were primed by their experience of the previous site.

My low-fidelity prototype displays a redesigned site that is functional on mobile devices, ensuring that it will urely be adaptable to work online. A streamlined homepage displays the various directions one can go when visiting the WHO COVID-19 site, whether it be to gather general understanding, answer specific concerns, or look into innovative research and unfolding news. Immediately, users can access the Symptom Checker, answer questions about symptoms, demographics, and recent activity to get a recommendation. They can also look at local and global statistics from a collapsable module. By using one's location information, users can also use the Local Dashboard to get information tailored to their area.

I expanded from the original sketches of the wireframes/flow to make a mock-site that can demonstrate the tasks and features I wanted to create, as well as generally improve upon the interface throughout. By doing so, I am able to create a functional display of my initial ideas, which gives a formalized, professional display nearing the final product. Through a high fidelity prototype, I am able to test the tools and features rounds of user testing, design evaluation, and persona/scenario creation has led me to develop. From here, I am able to get a firsthand sense of the potential points of confusion, visual pitfalls, and awkwardness in flow users may come across when using what's supposed to be an improved-upon resource.

## Conclusion
I was initally drawn to UX/UI coming from a general creative background of art, illustration, and DIYs, and so, my first thought is to lightly plan things out, but then to do the thing and [make]. While I had a starting intuition towards visual design and process thinking, undergoing a full cycle of user experience design revealed to me the layers (!!!) of underlying research, planning, consultation, feedback, and hypothetical/critical thinking that goes into truly developing a product (A week per step! Realistically even longer in industry! Done in teams that have to work and communicate with eachother!). I gained a more holistic understanding of what drives user experience design, from defining your project, purpose, and audience, as well as the technical skills from software to formal documentation that will enable me to apply this towards personal projects and hopefully a career later on.

Firsthand experience with project structure also helped train a better sense of 'designing with direction' in mind, accounting for trade-offs and the grounded logistics of having to cater to target audiences. I also enjoyed the overarching idea of applying the project towards public good and community benefit, as it instilled in me a greater consciousness about how UX/UI plays a role in how we are all able to utilize public resources.
