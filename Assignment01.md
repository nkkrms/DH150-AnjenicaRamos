#### Working Interest: Coronavirus Resource Site Improvement
When deciding what kind of public websites/apps I wanted to evaluation, what mattered most to me was its relevance and utility. Inspired by current events, I'm interested in focusing my heuristic evaluation here, as well as my overall project, on government resources in relation to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. My first site of choice is the Coronavirus information site for the World Health Organization (WHO), serving as as a trustworthy international source on COVID-19. The second is the state of California's re-employment initiative, which seeks to find jobs for those whose employments were affected by the pandemic.
In real time, we are seeing the way information (and misinformation, and confusion, and hysteria) influence public action. I believe the manner this information is conveyed its also key in making sure it is effective and enacted. In this way, UX design plays an underlyingly pivotal role in the connection of the public to information to a course of action. Especially in quarantine conditions where human interaction is restricted, it is especially hard to seek help from others. As many are left to their own devices, we are increasingly reliant on the internet to navigate this critical time. Therefore, it is an underlying urgency that we ensure these online resources' usability. 




## Site01: [World Health Organization: COVID-19 Pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)

#### 1. Visibility of System Status
A hotizontal section of the site is dedicated to statistics of the current outbreak, displaying the number of confirmed cases (presumably worldwide, since it doesn't explicitly say), confirmed deaths (again, assumed to be worldwide), and the count of countries infected. What's nice in this section is they include in a smaller, undistracting font, when these values are updated (which is within the day of when I viewed it). Since users can see these are quite current, it increases the reliability of the site.  

This is minor, but *most* clickable buttons and link on the site are 'highlighted' as an underline of the words or symbols you're hovering over. However, this is not the case for all links, making it uncertain which things are clickable to navigate to other pages, as well as which texts are just are colored a certain way for stylistic purposes or because they indicate they're a link or just supporting text. 


#### 2. Match Between System + Real World
The WHO site does a good job in terms of their vocabulary use and understandability of their information. When it comes to explanatory information, like basic protective measures, they give concise instructions in laymans terms. They also have accompanying informational videos for some items.
ex. about Maintain social distancing
###### "Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
###### Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease."
I also notice that the site does well to explain acronyms and list the formal codes of medical conditions
ex. this description of an online training resource on SARS, 
###### "Thist is intended for clinicians who are working in intensive care units (ICUs) in low and middle-income countries and managing adult and pediatric patients with severe forms of acute respiratory infection (SARI), including severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock. It is a hands-on practical guide to be used by health care professionals involved in clinical care management during outbreaks of influenza virus (seasonal) human infection due avian influenza virus (H5N1, H7N9), MERS-CoV, COVID-19 or other emerging respiratory viral epidemics." 
This is critical since a countless people will be viewing this site, all coming from a range of background expertise. Certain areas of the cite are intended for the general public ("What is a coronavirus?", "How to protect yourself?"), while others are for more technical infomation ("Clinical Trials Registry Platform", "Database of Publications"), and the language used matches these levels of understanding. 


#### 3. User Control + Freedom
At the top of each page, the site displays the page path in respect to the WHO's main page, which is helpful in keeping in mind what areas and categories of the site you are on as you delve deeper into its contents. Each page 'outside' of the one you're currently on is hyperlinked as well, which provides an easy exit and way to backtrack your steps.



#### 4. Consistency + Standards
The WHO has the signature colors of a bright blue and white for their branding, which is evident in the site. This is also used on the category bars on the top of the screen. However, some bars are orange instead, which may have been done to draw attention to those specific tabs, but it is unclear as to what system is used to distinguish what gets what color. 

Also, more cosmetic, the site has various inconsistencies in capitalization and symbol use with (and vs. &). For example, a category bar as "Country & technical guidance", "Media resources", "Your questions answered", but also "Research and Development" and "Public Advice" with both words capitalized and spelled out 'and'. 

In relation, what topics/categories were chosen to be bars also seems somewhat arbitrary. These buttons would be a good area to add some icons to the side of the word explanations of these buttons, to make it a bit easier to glance at a particular bar of interest as opposed to reading through this list (which is not alphabetized or seem to be displayed in any particular order). This would also related to heuristic no. 7 of efficiency as well as no. 8 design. Additionally, some of these bars open new tabs, while others change the tab you're currently on. 

"Your questions answered" bar at top of the page opens a tab headed as "Q&A on coronaviruses (COVID-19)" (https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses), which features a list of questions on an accordion list whose answers can be displayed when clicked on an expanded. It'd be nice if there was just consistency between the names of these two pages, as the Q&A area is actually not a part of the WHO's coronavirus sites, but its general Newsroom area. 

Also, this information here under the "Your questions answered" bar *seems* as though it should overlap with the "What you need to know" list at the bottom of the page, but it does not. Even more confusing, this list fatures a page called "Questions & answers" that links to a different Q&A site that an infinite scrolling list of multiple topics, with only a couple questions being related to the coronavirus at all (https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail). 
The categorization of the 4 bottom page lists also seems arbitrary, as a several top page bars are chunked under "Your questions answered," and it is this bunch of pages which would likely be most accessed by the general public, while the "Research and Developments" bar gets its own list.


#### 5. Error Prevention 
The search bar area, which allows you to sift through the WHO's entire site, displays suggestions when accidentally inputing a word/phrase with a typo. It also features autosuggestions based on the word you're typing. 

Pages linked on the landing page either open a new tab or change the tab you're currently on. Those that open new tabs are helpful because you don't lose your place on the main page. However, all linked pages generally feature a '<' symbol on the top left area to go back to the main as well, so even if its loads over the page you're on, you can find your way back (it just starts at the top, though). 

#### 6. Recognition > Recall
Th

#### 7. Flexibility + Effectivity of Use
At the top of the page, the site has several category bars that form an upside down 'L' around a latest updates videos. When you click on these, they open new tabs on your brower and each have their own subsections. With this setup, you'd have to click through all these bars to discover these subsections. It'd be better if users could hover over each bar and have the subsections appear to make the site navigation more streamlined for finding relevant information. This would increase efficiency for those seeking something specific and returning visitors who know where they want to go. 

While the site does feature multiple ways to get to certain pages, I would say that how this is displayed seems less efficient for its use. Much of the 10 tabs at the top of the page reappear as links in the 4 listed categories at the bottom of the page, making it seem like there is more information than there really is since these lead to the same places. I suspect that maybe the intention was to make things accessible without having to scroll all the way up, but due to these labeled inconsistently (heuristic no.4), and the page itself not being that long, this doesn't seem to provide much improvement to user experience. 



#### 8. Aesthetics + Minimal Design
The landing page is a long scrolling site with various links to other pages on the site, imbedded videos, and articles. However, what I noticed as I scrolled through was the inconsistencies in how many 'columns' each subsection of the long scroll featured. It would fluctuate between having 3, then 2, then 4, then 2, then 3, then 4 side-by-side items (in that order), which makes everything look quite cluttered. Its easy to be overwhelmed with everything presented, and there is not much intuition as to a natural order of things. The lack of symmetry due to the layout is also quite bothersome in an aesthetic sense.

Also, the top of the page's category bars snake around a featured video, which seems to be prominently placed as it is the latest conference update from the WHO. It just makes little sense to me as to why they would format the bars in such way. It would be much more functional and essentials focused if there was a fully horizontal or fully vertical line of these boxes. 


#### 9. Helps Users Recognize/Diagnose/Recover from Errors
This site is meant to serve as an information resource, and evokes simple actions of clicking, playing videos, and scrolling from users. For the most part, users are just seeking information here, so there is not much error they can cause. In using the search bar, ncluding a typo will prompt a warning statement pointing out the spelling error, and automatically corrects the search. 

Upon testing the site's 404 error display, inspired by the provided past assignment 01s, the WHO does seem to have a designated 'This page cannot be found' protocol. It does express clearly that the user may have come across this error because "the web address is incorrect or the file has been moved or deleted," in this way, allowing them to recognize the problem and diagnose it. They also then prompt actionable solutions to return to the WHO homepage via hyperlink, double-check the URL entered, or report this issue through their suggestions page (also linked). Pretty straightforward and effective.



#### 10. Help Documentation
There is not an explicit "help" area of the site, nor a shorthand guide as to where to find which resources, etc. This may come in handy due to the lack of natural flow to the site, per the confusing double inclusion of links and cluttered interface. However, this would not be less necessary given changes to the overall site. Mistaken navigation with the 404 not found displays seem to cover most of the potentially needed help, otherwise.
