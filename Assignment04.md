### Main Design Challenge
The World Health Organization is a trusted international health agency which coordinates health efforts within countries of the United Nations, and, thus, currently serves as a leading source towards COVID-19 initiatives. This project will povide insight towards improving the presnetation of the information and navigation on their [COVID-19 site](coronavirus.com), which features factual basics, advice and resources, as well as regularly updated regulations and statistics of the ongoing pandemic for the public.

In a way, this activity addresses the user's basic need of safety and security because having correct, up-to-date, easily accessible information about the Coronavirus and proper precautions is key in keeping themselves, their families, and others healthy. Effective widespread knowledge will be key towards active, collective efforts to stop its spread and flatten the curve.

Common current solution to seeking COVID-19 info is going on the internet (i.e. googling a question, most likely clicking on the first links or the most eye-catching, sensationalized article title) or watching the news. Even social media sites/apps like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have began implementing informational banners or news area to give users access. 

However, the problems with this is the lack of accuracy that can come with how this information is presented. The internet is also a place for conspiracy theories, opinions, and political biases to contort the facts. This addition of noise makes it difficult to get the straightforward fact and truth. A trustworthy, scientifically-backed site such as the WHO's could --and should be -- a one stop shop for need-to-know basics. 


### Target Users
**Demographics**: internet users -- likely smartphone users or computer owners, likely adults and older adults 
**Preferences**: prefer resources from the direct organization (instead of, say, social media, YouTube, word of mouth), text-based information presentation 
**Expertise**: users need basic knowledge on internet navigation to reach site, but no particular expertise to use it

Users would likely access the site on their computer/laptop, or, becoming more commonly, on their smartphone device. This is not a site of leisure one typically goes on to explore, so users typically come with pre-existing questions or curiosities. A quick google may lead them here. The activity of finding information is not related to a particular place, but more of a variety situations -- a question pops up in their mind, something in their life causes the need for information. For example, they may need to go to the grocery store soon: What procautions should they take? How does one wear a mask? Or, the local news announces their county is extending lockdowns. What are the current policies in place for other locations? 
To complete this activity, users would go on the site and click on the appropriate categorical tabs that may hold the information of their query. However, based on the specificities of the questions in mind, it may take some searching deeper into the site to find this information - something this project hopes to address. 



### Observational Method
For this project, I will utilize participatory observation and interview with a member of the target audience, since usage of this site is, as previously said, based more on occasion and not location. 
> This will allow me to inquire the opinions, concerns, and preferences of the target audience.
