### Main Design Challenge
The World Health Organization is a trusted international health agency which coordinates health efforts within countries of the United Nations, and, thus, currently serves as a leading source towards COVID-19 initiatives. This project will povide insight towards improving the presnetation of the information and navigation on their [COVID-19 site](coronavirus.com), which features factual basics, advice and resources, as well as regularly updated regulations and statistics of the ongoing pandemic for the public.

In a way, this activity addresses the user's basic need of safety and security because having correct, up-to-date, easily accessible information about the Coronavirus and proper precautions is key in keeping themselves, their families, and others healthy. Effective widespread knowledge will be key towards active, collective efforts to stop its spread and flatten the curve.

Common current solution to seeking COVID-19 info is going on the internet (i.e. googling a question, most likely clicking on the first links or the most eye-catching, sensationalized article title) or watching the news. Even social media sites/apps like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have began implementing informational banners or news area to give users access. 

However, the problems with this is the lack of accuracy that can come with how this information is presented. The internet is also a place for conspiracy theories, opinions, and political biases to contort the facts. This addition of noise makes it difficult to get the straightforward fact and truth. A trustworthy, scientifically-backed site such as the WHO's could --and should be -- a one stop shop for need-to-know basics. 


### Target Users
**Demographics**: internet users -- likely smartphone users or computer owners, likely adults and older adults \
**Preferences**: prefer resources from the direct organization (instead of, say, social media, YouTube, word of mouth), text-based information presentation \
**Expertise**: users need basic knowledge on internet navigation to reach site, but no particular expertise to use it

Users would likely access the site on their computer/laptop, or, becoming more commonly, on their smartphone device. This is not a site of leisure one typically goes on to explore, so users typically come with pre-existing questions or curiosities. A quick google may lead them here. The activity of finding information is not related to a particular place, but more of a variety situations -- a question pops up in their mind, something in their life causes the need for information. For example, they may need to go to the grocery store soon: What procautions should they take? How does one wear a mask? Or, the local news announces their county is extending lockdowns. What are the current policies in place for other locations? 
To complete this activity, users would go on the site and click on the appropriate categorical tabs that may hold the information of their query. However, based on the specificities of the questions in mind, it may take some searching deeper into the site to find this information - something this project hopes to address. 


### Observational Method
For this project, I will utilize participatory observation and interview with a member of the target audience, since usage of this site is, as previously said, based more on occasion and not location. 
> This will allow me to inquire the opinions, concerns, and preferences of the target audience. 


### Pariticpatory Research Materials
[**Script/Question Guide**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1okslFKfnuw8mabo1-uNOji7by13AlG4LxB2dV9SFGIY/edit?usp=sharing): includes the interview script, goals, questions

**User Data**: [recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jr4zaNjK-zqentyoJi8htjA4_P-YTTc9/view?usp=sharing) + [transcript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gQ9EJI-U6QG28_Ggtsfc7E66KRJudR2DGVqdoz2bvnU/edit?usp=sharing)


### Key Insights
**Credibility is key**: The participant emphasized several times that the credibility of the source was important to whether they would use and trust it. The credibility they seek comes with a set of expectations, so I believe this would be critical in considering the in the site's UI as well as the formality of the information presented.

**Did not scroll through the whole site**: Notably, the participant focused on the top section of the site, which does appear to be its own set of coherent features separated from the bottom half. Despite some nudges to explore the site, it was clear that this is where attention was centered.
> This brings me to consider the necessity of the lower page portions, as well as what could potentially become overlooked if many users approached the site in this way. 

**Seeking relevant, actionable information**: The World Health Organization definitely stems to serve the public in an international scope. However, the user repeatedly mentioned the importance of having local, or statewide, etc. level informations as well. 
> While this may require deeper implementation, this gave me the idea of the site being able to use location information to have a special section of information or resources (even if links) catered to that user's area. 



### Reflection
This was a fun, dynamic process to gather insight for the project. I found it more easygoing to be able to let the participant talk more free-handedly, as opposed to the Usability Testing. Of course, it is still valid and necessary to have prompted investigation, but I find that this was more holistic because you also focus on the participant's general preferences, habits, to the whole situation. You definitely gain more insight as to their motivations and priorities, as well as get a sense of where their perspective is coming from. 

In all transparency, the participant was my dad, since I am home during shelter in place. I chose him as opposed to my brother, who participated in my UT assignment, because of the opinions and concerns he raised originally and how I thought another demographic may respond to them. I found it interesting how they shared differing opinions at some points (my brother preferring instant, easy-to-spot information, while my dad preferring long, thorough answers). As the professor suggested, not using the same person was insightful to get a range of feedback, as well as further considerations when balancing a diverse/general audience. 

In terms of the process, I did find it somewhat difficult to design a context-based inquiry, and not just soley focusing on the site specifically. Since my topic is based on finding information (versus apps that serve particular functions in situations), it was difficult to come up with interview questions that were encompassing of the whole topic or their experience separated from the site or general usage of other resources. I also felt kind of "primed" by my Usability Testing experience -- in a good way, it asserted me to prompt clarifying questions, things that addressed user experience and other factors, but in a negative way, I'm not too sure if I did this *'correctly'* because my approaches to both may be similar. 

Nonetheless, I also want to say that using this research method is helpful regardless because I was able to let the participant wander, speak freely, and gather numerous insights that I couldn't have planned for. While I definitely do have the transcript to refer to, I also found that observing their behavior was informative. I was able to see what drew their attention and how they make assumptions/infer without having prior experience on the site even if it was not strictly prompted.
