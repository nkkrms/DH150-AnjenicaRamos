### Project Overview: W.H.O. Covid-19 site 
The World Health Organization is a trusted international health agency which coordinates health efforts within countries of the United Nations, and, thus, currently serves as a leading source towards COVID-19 initiatives. This project will povide insight towards improving the presnetation of the information and navigation on their COVID-19 site, which features factual basics, advice and resources, as well as regularly updated regulations and statistics of the ongoing pandemic for the public. Prior user research with site testing and interviews have revealed problems in the current website's interface structure, as well as a lack of key, actionable resources, such as COVID-19 information that pertain to a user's location and a symptom-checker. 

Through the creations of personas and scenarios, I was able to explore these problems further, and my work thusfar has led me to design the following features in a mobile version of the site: 
1. **A more organized tabular homepage** -- overall cleaning how the landing page is presented because clashing formats, colors, lacking of design heuristics makes the site slightly disfunctional and discouraging to use
> For this, I imagined a 47-year old father, teacher, and department chair, Dan Miller, whom many in his network reply on for guidance and reliable information. This largely follows the high, yet everyday stakes that come with seeking COVID-19 info, as users need well-designed resources to be able to understand the details themselves (minimalist organization and communication), be able to refer back to this time and time again (where credibility and memorability come into play), and this resource to others (i.e. intuition for a broad, public audience). 

3. **Local links/resources** -- it'd be nice if the site can use your location information to have a section about local statistics, local resources, and local guidelines (ex. shelter in place regulations)
> For this feature, I pictured a work-from-home milennial user, Bethany Ramirez, who has just relocated to a new area for work. They are tech-savvy enough to seek information from the internet, and particularly need guidance in navigating the pandemic while settling in an area whose local sanctions, resources, and statistics are unfamiliar to them. While one could scower the internet and numerous unkwnown organizations' websites and news agencies, it'd be nice to have these all featured, or vetted and linked. This benefits multiple parties by connecting users to local offerings and them to their target audience.  

2. **A Symptom checker/sickness protocol** -- there is currently not a section which focuses on COVID-19 symptoms, as well as action items for users to take if they think they may have COVID-19, how to get tested, when to seek help, etc.
> Here, I envisioned Kathryn Chen, a small business-owner and single parent for whom English is not their first language. In a situation where she may have been exposed to the coronavirus, she needs key symptom information to take necessary steps for her health as well as planning childcare for her daughter. This addresses such a critical situation with trustworthy action steps, which is especially key in an internet full of pseudoscience remedies and varying experiences. 

Now, through low-fidelity prototyping, I can begin bringing these ideas to life. Through drafting user interface designs and creating a workflow of users' interactions with the mobile site, I am able to translate the research insights to a (rough!) product. From here, testing is key to see designs in action and gather feedback for improvement. It is always important to consult participants to understand design shortcomings from outside perspectives that the designer may be blind to. From here, we can then refine designs to continue with the product's development.
