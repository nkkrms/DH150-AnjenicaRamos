### Purpose of UX STORYTELLING
Prior user research enabled me, the designer, to learn basic needs of potential users from their behaviors. However, observing and testing only a small number of volunteers, this does not give a complete picture of the product's audience. My volunteer subjects may also hold particular quirks or personal preferences that do not generalize to the spectrum of users the product must account for. So, to further research, user experience storytelling will provide a way to consider other hypothetical users by building personas and stories, taking into account thei demographics, motivations, and mannerisms, which can all influence their interaction with the product. 
> Through UX storytelling, we are able to understand more vividly *why* various users may seek the product and *how* yjr product can be improved. We are also able to better consider design trade-offs to cater to multiple audiences, improve functionality, and design to meet their needs and goals, which designates the success of developing a product for public use.
